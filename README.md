## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files to ensure clarity and maintainability:

- **`src/`**: Contains the core source code for the project.
  - **`index.html`**: The main entry point of the website.
  - **`style.css`**: Defines the visual styling of the platform.
  - **`script.js`**: Implements client-side interactivity and logic.
  - **`library/`**: Houses external libraries and modular components.
    - **`scripts/spotify.js`**: Handles Spotify API integration for music-related features.
    - **`css/`**: Contains additional CSS files for extended styling.

- **`assets/`**: Stores static assets such as images, icons, and fonts.
- **`database/`**: Includes data files used for testing and development purposes.
  - **`database.txt`**: A placeholder file for storing sample data.
